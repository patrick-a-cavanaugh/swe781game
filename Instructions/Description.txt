I am going to do a turn-based, multiplayer (2-players in each "universe", although multiple simultaneous games may be
supported) game where players move a piece (ship) between different locations (planets). At each location they can buy
or sell one of several resources from a local marketplace. After a fixed number of moves are made by both parties to the
game, it ends and the player with the greatest net worth is declared the victor by the server.
